## NOTES

<p>
I'm a <b>stubborn self-taugh web developer</b>, I've started in web development in Henry Bootcamp,
then I've obtained the FreeCodeCamp certifications for, responsive web design, javascript, and
front-end libraries, in addition I've made a QA tester course on utn-free. I'm a proud *nux, in my free time I do in my free time is to lear about cybersec. I'd like to contribute on github project
or smt like that, contributing to open software would make me very proud, so that's on my
bucket list.

My goal is to use my experience as web dev and match it with my new testing knowdlege,
maybe I'd be able to become a dev ops in the future if I work ward
